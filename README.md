# Swirl
A sandbox game that allows you to create and save structures with boxes, circles, and more.
# Installation
Swirl is available on the web [here.](https://atenfyr.github.io/swirl/) Alternatively, there is a Windows desktop app available [here.](https://github.com/atenfyr/swirl/releases)
# Building
While index.html should run out of the box, you can also build your own copy of the Windows desktop app. All you need are global copies of [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder) and [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron). After that, just run `npm install` to install all the dependencies and `npm start` to boot it up or `npm dist` to build an installer.
