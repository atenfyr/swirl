# Swirl
A sandbox game that allows you to create and save structures with boxes, circles, and more.
# Installation
Swirl is available on the web [here.](https://atenfyr.github.io/swirl/) Alternatively, there is a Windows desktop app available [here.](https://github.com/atenfyr/swirl/releases)
# Building
While index.html should run out of the box, you can also build your own copy of the Windows desktop app. You'll need to install global copies of electron and electron-builder with npm. After that, just run `npm install` to install all the dependencies and `npm start` to boot it up or `npm dist` to build an installer.
